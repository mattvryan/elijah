Elijah is a genealogical tool to search your own family tree.  It performs two main functions:

* It identifies *gaps* and potential gaps in your family tree where information can be provided.
* It identifies *temple opportunities* - members in your family tree who are eligible for temple work but who have not yet had it performed on their behalf.

Elijah is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.
